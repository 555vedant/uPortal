This JSP provides default rendering for labels embedded within the hierarchical 
tree generated by the org/jasig/portal/channels/jsp/tree/renderer.jsp. Its 
default labeling for aspects, nodes, and actions is to return the value of
treeModel.labelData as a String as-is for embedding as the label for that
object.

The model passed to all plugged-in label rendering JSPs from
org/jasig/portal/channels/jsp/tree/renderer.jsp is:

--- requestScope.baseActionUrl
a String representing a URL for directing user responses back to the channel
containing the tree.

--- requestScope.treeModel
an instance of org.jasig.portal.channels.jsp.tree.Model. See that class for a 
description of all attributes available for use in label renderer JSPs.
