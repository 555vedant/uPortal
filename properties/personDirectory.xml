	<!-- the default implementation of PersonDirectory is a legacy implementation which hard-codes in
		Java the configuration of PersonDirectory using the legacy PersonDirs.xml .
		
		Your options for customizing the PersonDirectory implementation for your institution:
		1) Ignore this XML file.  Ignore the implementing Java code.  Customize PersonDirs.xml to declare your 
		institutions attribute sources.
		2) Ignore this XML file.  Decide that the flexibility provided by PersonDirs.xml doesn't meet your needs.
		Edit the LegacyPersonDirectoryImpl class and/or the classes it uses to customize the Java logic
		 that implements PersonDirectory.
		3) Edit this XML file to use Spring to configure PersonDirectory, declaring different configurations of the
		distributed classes and/or using your own classes.
		
		This personDirectory.xml file is likely a temporary solution that will be replaced before uPortal 2.5 is released, in favor of
		PersonDirectory discovering an ApplicationContext that might be shared with other components.
