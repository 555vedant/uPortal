This is a file for notes specific to the uPortal release that the code you're looking at
either is (in the case of a tagged release) or will become (in the case of the tip of a patches or main branch).


Release notes for uPortal 2.5.0 RC 1:



This is a "release candidate".  It is intended to bring about feature freeze and an increased attention to
bugfixes and quality assurance so that we can release our project.


Known issues



There are many known bugs in this release.  You can query our JIRA system for known issues affecting this release, including
issues discovered after this release went to press.

In particular, there is a known issue with our use of context.xml in the META-INF directory of the produced webapp.
Please see the README.  You will likely need to take a manual step locally for this application's context to properly deploy.


This release includes many improvements, fixes, and other changes beyond 2.5.0 M1, which in turn included many
changes beyond 2.5.0.

The release egineer's system:

Lynn Hollerman asked that we document what systems a release was tested on.  This is only the first release candidate, and
so while we're making an effort to produce a quality release, it has several serious known issues and isn't as well
tested as we would like.  For what it's worth: the release engineer (Andrew Petro, Yale) informally tested this release
before tagging on
a Windows / Tomcat 5.0.25 / Java 1.4.2_04 with JAXP 1.3 extensions against the default HSQLDB database via 
the clean, runtests, initportal Ant build sequence.

The actual release distribution was produced on a Red Hat linux machine using Jdk 1.5.0_02 . (Note: since you'll need to
build from source for your environment, as the distribution does not contain uPortal .class, .jar, or .war files produced
by the build, using JDK 1.5 to produce the release should not affect JDK 1.4 compatibility.)

The release was then tested in the Windows environment described above.
