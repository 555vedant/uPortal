README for basic uPortal usage


Manifest
----------------------------------------
build.properties    o Contains configuration for the build file that needs to
                      be customized for your environment.
build.xml           o Contains the ant build targets for working with uPortal.


Library Dependencies
----------------------------------------
IMPORTANT Instructions for JDK1.4
uPortal uses the JAXP 1.3 compatability libraries for its XML APIs. The JAXP
libraries need to be copied into the endorsed library locations for the JRE
and Tomcat.

The libraries are included with uPortal in the lib/jaxp directory.
    Copy them to the lib/endorsed directory of the JRE
    Copy them to the common/endorsed directory of Tomcat

There is a target in the ant build file named 'JAXP-Install' which will
copy the files into these locations for you.


Initial Configuration
----------------------------------------
To deploy uPortal you must set the server.home variable in the
build.properties file to the instance of Tomcat you want to deploy to.


Initial Deployment
----------------------------------------
The initportal target must be run before uPortal is started the first time.
This target will take care of compiling, deploying, database population and
other initial tasks. Running initportal again is similiar to hitting a reset
button on the portal. Any saved configuration in the portal is lost and a clean
version of the portal is configured.
