README for basic uPortal usage

For further help please refer to the uPortal home page http://www.uportal.org or
the uPortal Confluence site http://jasigch.princeton.edu:9000/display/UPC/Home

Manifest
----------------------------------------
build.properties    o Contains configuration for the build file that needs to
                      be customized for your environment.
build.xml           o Contains the ant build targets for working with uPortal.

Ant Depdency
----------------------------------------

The build.xml needs to be run under Ant 1.6.2 or better.  Some of our Ant tasks
have been reported to fail on Ant 1.6.1 and earlier.


Library Dependencies
----------------------------------------
IMPORTANT Instructions for JDK1.4
uPortal uses the JAXP 1.3 compatability libraries for its XML APIs. The JAXP
libraries need to be copied into the endorsed library locations for the JRE
and Tomcat.

Please refer to the README file in lib/jaxp


Initial Configuration
----------------------------------------
To deploy uPortal you must set the server.home variable in the
build.properties file to the instance of Tomcat you want to deploy to.


Initial Deployment
----------------------------------------
The initportal target must be run before uPortal is started the first time.
This target will take care of compiling, deploying, database population and
other initial tasks. Running initportal again is similiar to hitting a reset
button on the portal. Any saved configuration in the portal is lost and a clean
version of the portal is configured.
