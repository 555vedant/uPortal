<p>This is a file for notes specific to
<a href="http://www.ja-sig.org/wiki/x/0gBl">uPortal 2.6.0 release candidate 2</a>.  Part of the point of
a release candidate release is to make a particular snapshot of progress evailable for
review and evaluation, so what is known up front and could have been included in these release
notes will be less than what is discovered about the release candidate post release.</p>
<p>Therefore, please see <a href="http://www.ja-sig.org/wiki/x/0gBl">this release's wiki page</a> for more information.</p>

<ul>
<li>JDK 1.5 or later</li>
<li>Tomcat 5.x (5.5.x preferred).  Other servlet containers may work. YMMV.</li>

these and HSQLDB are commonly used in development; specific vendors and
versions are supported via declaration in the DbLoader utility; if you want to use
a different database you'll need to declare its eccentricities there.)</li>
