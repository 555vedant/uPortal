			This package exists to support the PropertiesManager.  
			PropertiesManager hasn't been moved here in order to maintain backwards compatibility of its fully qualified classname.
			(Otherwise it would be kind of nice to move it here out of the way.)
			This package contains custom RuntimeExceptions thrown by PropertiesManager and a simple Servlet which will
			expose as XML the list of properties the PropertiesManager has been asked about but could not find.
			This package also includes a test properties file used by a JUnit testcase that exercises the PropertiesManager.
			It's over here in the source tree instead of the tests tree because it was easier for PropertiesManager to find it here.
