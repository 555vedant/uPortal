			About this fragment
		</div>
		<div class="portlet-font">
			The Error Handling fragment demonstrates uPortal's robust and informative channel error handling.
		</div>
		<div class="portlet-section-subheader">
			Thrower
		</div>
		<div class="portlet-font">
			CThrower throws a nested exception during channel rendering.  It demonstrates CError.
			For an administrative user, CError will present a UI allowing the admin to view the stack trace.
			For a regular user, CError shows the monkey wrench icon and an error message.
		</div>
		<div class="portlet-font">
			It is normal for CThrower to fail to render with error code 1 (channel rendering error).  
			Regular users will see the message "This channel failed to render".
		</div>
		<div class="portlet-section-subheader">
			Timeout
		</div>
		<div class="portlet-font">
			CTimeout blocks for a long time, longer than its configured channel timeout.
			It will time out when rendering and be replaced by CError to notify that it has timed out.
			Timeout exists in this layout to demonstrate both the user experience and the 
			behavior of the underlying code - CTimeout logs when it is interrupted by
			the channel rendering thread management.
		</div>
		<div class="portlet-font">
			It is normal for CTimeout to fail to render with error code 4 (channel timed out).
			Regular users will see the message "This channel failed to render".
