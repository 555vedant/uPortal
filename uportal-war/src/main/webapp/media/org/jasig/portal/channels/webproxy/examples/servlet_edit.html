<html><body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<font size=+1><b>Servlet Examples Edit</b></font>
<p>
This is just an example, so there's nothing really editable here.
But there could be.  Rather than pointing at another application,
you'd probably want to set the <i>cw_edit</i> to a query string containing
parameters that would tell the application to go into edit mode.

<form action="">
<font size=2>
<input type=hidden name="cw_reset" value="return">
<input type=submit value="Return to Channel">
</font>
</form>
</body></html>
