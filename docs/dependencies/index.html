<title>uPortal Dependencies</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This file documents the dependencies included with uPortal, their versions, sources, and the licensing that allows uPortal to 
redistribute them.  This file serves as a practical guide to the dependencies shipping with uPortal as well as a place to 
document the licenses under which they are included.</p>

<p>The uPortal distribution may include a number of other libraries, resources, and products.  Intellectual property.
This file exists for several reasons.  The first reason is that we'd like to acknowledge the important contributions
these other projects and resources make to our project.  The success of this project has been and continues to be dependent upon
the quality tools and resources produced by others in the Java community.</p>

<p>Some of these projects and resources we include in our distribution are subject to license agreements.
A second reason for this file to exist is to provide a place in the distribution where we reference the other files necessary for
our distribution to comply with the terms of these agreements and to document under what licenses we redistribute what libraries.</p>

<p>We have attempted here to comply with applicable license agreements and give credit where credit is due. If we have overlooked
acknowledgement of any contribution to this project please bring this to the attention of the uPortal developers.</p>
