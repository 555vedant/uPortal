README for uPortal Documents directory

In this directory you'll find documentation for JA-SIG's uPortal
framework. The documentation is in a few different formats, and you
can compile them into a few other formats as explained in the sections
below.


Manifest
--------
channel docs/          o Documentation for channel and content developers
developers/            o Documentation for portal framework developers
docs.xml               o Ant build file for convering the documentation into 
                         human reader-friendly formats
overview.xml           o An overview of compiling and installing uPortal 2.x
README                 o This file
website/               o A complete copy of the uPortal website. Some files
                         in this directory are generated as a result of the
                          process outlined below (see "Compiling"). 


Compiling
------------

To compile these source files into a more human-readable format, you
must have some tools already installed. Assuming that you already have
a copy of the Java Development Kit (JDK, version 1.2.2 or later)
installed for your platform, you can compile the documentation after
installing the following:

Tool                      Location (URL)
------------------------  --------------
Ant:                      jakarta.apache.org/ant/
DocBook XSL stylesheets:  sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=21935
FOP:                      xml.apache.org/fop/
Xalan:                    xml.apache.org/xalan/


The uPortal team is currently in the process of producing their own
stylesheets for DocBook XML, but until we have JA-SIG-specific
stylesheets, you can use the Norm Walsh stylesheets(so-called because
the author is Norm Walsh, the author of DocBook: The Definitive Guide
and a longtime proponent of DocBook).

From the URL shown above, download docbook-xsl-1.46-experimental. The
actual filenames will end in either .tar.gz or .zip, download the one
most appropriate for the platform you'll be working with. In the same
directory where you've placed portal/docs from the uPortal 2.0 source,
unpack this file so that you have a new directory named
"docbook-xsl-1.46-experimental". For example, I do most of my work on
Solaris, and after I've unpacked the file docbook-xsl-1.46.tar.gz, my
portal/docs directory looks like the following:

channel docs/
CVS/
developers/
docbook-xsl-1.46-experimental/
docs.xml
overview.xml
README
website/

- Compiling to .xhtml:

To produce .xhtml documentation, invoke ant with the docs.xml build
file and 'xhtml' as an argument. For example, on most UNIX-like
operating systems, issuing the following command in the shell will
begin the compilation process:


  ant -buildfile docs.xml xhtml

..you'll get a lot of error messages, but just ignore them. After a while, 
you'll get the following message:

BUILD SUCCESSFUL

Total time: 1 minute 35 seconds

...this is the time it takes on my vastly underpowered 300Mhz
machine. On yours it will undoubtedly take much less time.

Now you will be able to 'cd' into the 'website' directory and view the
resulting .xhtml files.
