README for uPortal Documents directory

In this directory you'll find documentation for JA-SIG's uPortal
framework. The documentation is in a few different formats, and you
can compile them into a few other formats as explained in the sections
below.


Manifest
--------
channel docs/          o Documentation for channel and content developers
developers/            o Documentation for portal framework developers
docs.xml               o Ant build file for convering the documentation into 
                         human reader-friendly formats
overview.xml           o An overview of compiling and installing uPortal 2.x
README                 o This file
website/               o A complete copy of the uPortal website. Some files
                         in this directory are generated as a result of the
                          process outlined below (see "Compiling"). 


Compiling
------------

To compile these source files into a more human-readable format, you
must have some tools already installed. Assuming that you already have
a copy of the Java Development Kit (JDK, version 1.2.2 or later)
installed for your platform, you can compile the documentation after
installing the following:

Tool                      Location (URL)
------------------------  --------------
Ant:                      jakarta.apache.org/ant/
DocBook XSL stylesheets:  sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=21935
FOP:                      xml.apache.org/fop/
Xalan:                    xml.apache.org/xalan/
