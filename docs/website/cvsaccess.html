<P><B>CVS Access on Windows </B></P> 
<P> On Windows, you need one of the following software
products for each category: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>CVS client</LI>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.wincvs.org">WinCVS 1.1b7 or greater (GUI client)</A></LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>SSH client/tunnel</LI>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.mindbright.com/mindterm/">MindBright MindTerm Java SSH</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY Telnet/SSH Client</A></LI>
</UL>

</UL> 
<P> You can find other SSH clients
<A HREF="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/tech_docs/qref/ssh.html">here</A> but the above
are the only ones recommended since they do SSH tunneling (most SSH clients
just do terminal emulation). </P> 
<P> In addition, if you are behind a corporate firewall, your
best option is to use a socks proxy. Most SSH software knows how to traverse
socks proxies. In addition, there are socks utility programs that let you
"sockisfy" any application. Contact your sysadmin for details. </P> 

<P><B>How to Connect using MindTerm</B></P> 
					
<P> This is an illustrated example showing the MindTerm program. </P> 
<P> Assuming you have installed the Mindterm classes (or .jar
archive) on your system classpath (and, of course, that you have a Java virtual
machine available on your system), the first step is turn on the client. From
the DOS prompt type: </P> 
<BLOCKQUOTE> <CODE>java mindbright.application.MindTerm</CODE> </BLOCKQUOTE> 
						
<P> Connect to SSH host <em>mis105.mis.udel.edu</em> by selecting 
Settings, New Server from the menu, and then typing mis105.mis.udel.edu 
for the Server name. When you click Connect, your username will 
be requested and the password. Don't worry about transmitting your 
password since SSH is done exactly to allow you to transmit your 
password without worrying about sniffing and other security holes 
of normal remote shells. Now, go to the <EM>tunnels</EM> menu and 
select Basic to display the dialog box. Fill in the fields so that 
local port <EM>2401</EM> is directed to host "localhost" on the 
remote port 2401, as shown in the picture below: </P>
<IMG SRC="images/mindterm_tunnel.gif" WIDTH="587" HEIGHT="475"> 
						
<P> When mis105 welcomes you and its prompt appears, you can safely 
minimize your mindterm window since, for plain WinCVS operation, 
you won't need to type anything in the ssh terminal. The WinCVS 
client will send CVS commands thru the SSH tunnel transparently. 
</P> 
<P><B>How to Connect using PuTTY</B></P> 
				
<P> This is an illustrated example showing the PuTTY program. </P> 
<P> Assuming you have installed the PuTTy program launch it from Windows 
or a DOS prompt and the PuTTY configuration window will appear:
</P> 
					
<P> First, enter <em>mis105.mis.udel.edu</em> into the "Host Name (or IP Address)" 
field, then select <em>SSH</em> in the in the protocol section. Next, type in 
a session name in the &quot;Saved Sessions&quot; box (for example, uPortal CVS) 
and click on &quot;Save&quot;. The screen should appear as shown in the picture 
below: </P>

<IMG SRC="images/putty1.jpg" alt="putty1" border="0">
					
<P>Now, click on the Connection/SSH/Tunnels item in the categories window on the 
left (you may need to expand the menu). In the &quot;Add new forwarded section&quot;, 
type in the CVS port number (2401) into the source port box, then enter <em>mis105.mis.udel.edu:2401</em> 
into the Destination box. Make sure that "local" is check then click on the Add 
button. The screen should look like the picture below:</P>
<img src="images/putty2.jpg" border=0" alt="putty2">
<P>Click on the Save button, then on the Open button. When a new DOS window appears 
you will be prompted for a user id and password. This is your local user name 
and password. Once you have logged in, you can close the DOS window. The WinCVS 
client will send CVS commands thru the SSH tunnel transparently. </P>
<P><B>Launching the WinCVS client</B></P>
				  
<P> Launch the WinCVS client. The first time, it will ask you the basic configuration 
preferences that it needs. These are the CVS repository location and authentication 
information. The screenshot below tells you what you should enter. Note that you 
must replace the string <EM>username</EM> in the repository location with your 
own username on mis105. </P>
<IMG SRC="images/wincvs_config.gif" WIDTH="618" HEIGHT="390"> 
<P> At this point you software is setup and first thing to do
is to authenticate yourself on the CVS repository. This is done by logging in
the server with the menu <CODE>Admin -&gt; Login</CODE> and inserting your password. This action authenticates you into the CVS
server and saves your password (in a crypted form) in the <CODE>.cvspass</CODE> file in the home directory you specify. Note that you need to do this
only once per CVS repository, not everytime you connect to it, even if you
disconnected from that server. </P> 
				  
<P> Now your WinCVS client is ready to perform operations on
the remote CVS repository. First action to take is to <CODE>checkout</CODE> the <B>portal</B> module. To do this, first select the directory where
you want the files to be located. Note that the files will be automatically
placed in the <CODE><B>portal</B></CODE> subdirectory of the indicated directory. 
Then select the menu item <CODE>Create -&gt; Checkout module...</CODE>. After this, 
place <CODE><B>portal</B></CODE> in the module name field and you're ready to go. 
</P>
				  
<P><B>NOTE:</B> If you previously checked out uPortal using anonymous CVS, you 
can not use the same portal subdirectory. Every subdirectory contains a CVS directory, 
which contains a file calle &quot;<tt>Root</tt>&quot;. This file has the CVSROOT 
which was created when the anonymous checkout occured (<tt>:pserver:anonymous@mis105.mis.udel.edu:/home/cvs/jasig</tt>). 
In order to use the same directory this file will need to be modified so that 
it refers to the developers CVSROOT (<tt>:pserver:user@localhost:/home/cvs/jasig</tt>). 
It is recommend that a separate subdirectory be used for development.</P>

<P><B>CVS Access on Unix</B></P> 
<P>On Unix, you need the following software products: </P> 
<UL> 
<LI><A HREF="http://download.cyclic.com/pub/">CVS client
(pick up latest version)</A></LI> 
<LI><A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.hut.fi/pub/ssh/">SSH client (pick
up 1.x, not 2.x)</A> </LI> 
</UL> 
<P>Depending on your platform you may be able to pick up
precompiled versions or have to compile them yourself. </P> 
<P><B>Notes</B></P> 
<P>Since both CVS and SSH are based on open standards, there
are lots of CVS and SSH tools freely available on the net, both of command line
and GUI behavior. This means that any compliant implementations of those
standards should work as well. </P> 
<P>For some more software options as well as other tips and
tricks, see www.hyperreal.org/info/ssh </P> 
<P>In addition, if you are behind a corporate firewall, your
best option is to use a socks proxy. Most SSH software knows how to traverse
socks proxies. In addition, there are socks utility programs that let you
"sockisfy" any application. Contact your sysadmin for details. </P> 
<P><B>How to Connect</B></P> 
<P>The first step is to set up the SSH tunnel to mis105. To
do this, you need to have your SSH client software redirect your local port
2401 to the far side of the SSH connection. The command looks something like
this: </P> 
						
<P><CODE>ssh -L 2401:localhost:2401 user@mis105.mis.udel.edu </CODE></P> 
<P>The next step is to use the CVS pserver functionality to
login. You'll want to do this in a seperate terminal from the one that you
logged into mis105 with so that you check out the files to your local machine
and not to your account on mis105! This command looks like this: </P> 
<P><CODE>cvs -d :pserver:user@localhost:/home/cvs/jasig login </CODE></P> 
<P>Note that the CVS client thinks it is talking to a server
running on your local machine, but in fact is talking to the CVS pserver on
mis105 thanks to the SSH tunnel. After you login, you can check out any of the
source trees. The command to checkout the JA-SIG Portal source is: </P> 
<P><CODE>cvs -d :pserver:user@localhost:/home/cvs/jasig checkout portal 
</CODE></P> 
<P>Once you checkout a source tree, all CVS operations in
that source tree do not require the -d :pserver: argument. </P>
