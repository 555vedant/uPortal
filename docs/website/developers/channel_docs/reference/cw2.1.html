<h1>uPortal 2.1 CWebProxy Channel</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This document reflects the current development version of CWebProxy.  This
version will become part of uPortal 2.1.  To save you unneccessary reading,
I'll tell you that there is currently no difference in the docs.  CWebProxy
has been converted to a multithreaded caching channel.  Shortly this will
be checked in to the CVS repository and I'll add info. on the new caching
directives, and then you'll have something to read :-)
</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

CWebProxy allows incorporation of web-based services as channels.  It provides
mechanisms for connecting to and rendering HTML and XML services.  Pages
are refreshed when they change.  For applications under http, GET and POST
parameters are passed through the portal to the application.  This allows
communcation between the browser and the back-end application.  Cookies are
are kept within CWebProxy, allowing dynamic http applications to maintain
state.

<h2>Summary</h2>

The key mechanism is "<i>pass-through</i>".  It is the means for
<i>passing</i> request parameters <i>through</i> the portal to the
application.  There are currently four levels of pass-through supported:
<p>
Use "application" if you want references to the original
cw_xml to stay in the channel, and other links to go outside the portal
framework.  Use "all" if you want all links generated by the first URL
to stay in the channel.  Use "marked" if you want to indicate  
precisely which links should stay in channel, and which should replace
the framework, and "none" if you're not interested in having any of the
links stay in-channel. 
<p>
Note that it is possible to change the pass-through type at any point,
so if a link is followed that would best be served by another pass-though
type, it is a trivial matter to change it at that time.

<h2>Static Data and Runtime Data</h2>

With the exception of <b>cw_reset</b>, which is a runtime parameter only,
parameters are identical for both static and runtime data.
The channel state variables are initially set acccording to static data,
or defaults.  Runtime data modifies the equivalent channel state variables.
All parameters are then passed through to the stylesheets based on the current
state.  The parameters are:

<ul>
 <li><b>cw_xml</b>: a URI representing the source XML or HTML document.
 <li><b>cw_ssl</b>: a URI representing the corresponding .ssl
		(stylesheet list) file.
 <li><b>cw_xslTitle</b>: a title representing the stylesheet (optional).
                If no title parameter is specified, a default
                stylesheet will be chosen according to the media.
 <li><b>cw_xsl</b>: a URI representing the stylesheet to use.
                If <i>cw_xsl</i> is supplied, <i>cw_ssl</i>
                and <i>cw_xslTitle</i> will be ignored.
 <li><b>cw_info</b>: a URI to be called for the <i>info</i> event.
 <li><b>cw_help</b>: a URI to be called for the <i>help</i> event.
 <li><b>cw_edit</b>: a URI to be called for the <i>edit</i> event.
 <li><b>cw_tidy</b>: if set to <i>on</i>, filter the source document through
		JTidy, converting HTML to XHTML.
 <li><b>cw_passThrough</b>: indicates that runtime data is to be passed through.
                If <i>passThrough</i> is supplied, and not set
                to "none", additional runtime data parameters and values
                will be passed as request parameters to the
                <i>cw_xml</i>.
    <br>cw_passThrough values:
    <ul>
      <li><b>none</b>: (default).  Don't do anything.

      <li><b>marked</b>: If runtime data includes
		<i>cw_inChannelLink</i>, pass through other runtime data as
		request parameters.
		Use in conjunction with a stylesheet that marks appropriate
		links with cw_inChannelLink as a request parameter, and replaces
		the URI with baseActionURL, possibly with cw_xml and maybe
		other parameters.

      <li><b>all</b>: This parameter instructs the render routine to pass
		through all additional runtime data as http request parameters
		to xmlURI.
		Intended to support XHTML dynamic pages.  With
		JTidy hooked in, can support HTML as well.  Use in conjunction
		with a style sheet that re-routes all links through the portal.

      <li><b>application</b>: The same as <i>all</i>.  Use in conjunction with
 		a style sheet that re-routes links for that application
		through the portal.
   </ul>
 <li><b>cw_reset</b> An instruction to reset internal variables.
                The value <i>return</i> resets <i>cw_xml</i>
                to its last value before changed by button events.  The
                value <i>reset</i> returns all variables to the static data
                values.  (reset not impl. yet.)  Runtime data parameter only.
</ul>

<p>
Note: parameter names have changed from the previous version of CWebProxy.
cw_xsl and cw_xslTitle are there for compatibility with CGenericXSLT and
might go away.

<h3>Portal Events</h3>

<p>CWebProxy supports the button events for <i>help</i>, <i>about</i>, and
<i>edit</i>.  A channel instance can specify URIs for any of these via
static or runtime data.  A button event will then redirect the channel
to the appropriate URI.  Note that separate stylesheets for button event
URIs are not supported.  The URI should return control to the original
application via <i>cw_reset=return</i>.

<h2>Stylesheets</h2>
<p>
This stylesheet is set up for typical dynamic applications.  You may need
to make modifications to suit particular applications.

<h3>xhtml.xsl</h3>

<p>For use with XHTML or HTML applications.

<p>The base URI is determined from cw_xml, or from the href element of
the <b>&lt;base&gt;</b> tag, if one exists in the document head.  Note
that this is different from the baseActionURL, which is a URI referring
to the channel via the portal.

<p><b>&lt;script&gt;</b> elements are copied from both <b>&lt;head&gt;</b>
and <b>&lt;body&gt;</b>.  Relative URIs in <i>src</i> attributes are prepended
with the base URI.

<p>Children of <b>&lt;body&gt;</b> are copied as is, save for the following
   special processing:
<ul>
  <li><b>&lt;form&gt;</b>  If the <i>action</i> attribute is a relative URL,
    the absolute URL is found using the cw_xml parameter.  Its value is then
    modified according to the value of <i>cw_passThrough</i>:

    <ul>
      <li><b>none</b> (default): action is left as is unless it is a relative
	URL, in which case it is prepended with the base URI.

      <li><b>marked</b>: if there's an <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> child of form
	with a name attribute called 'cw_inChannelLink', the action attribute
        of the form is changed to equal the baseActionURL, no matter what
	the value was before.

      <li><b>application</b>: if either the action attribute is empty or
	the cw_xml parameter is equivalent to the absolute URL of the action
	attribute, the action attribute is set to the baseActionURL.

      <li><b>application</b>: if either the action attribute is empty or the
        cw_xml parameter is equivalent to action attribute or cw_xml equals
        the base URI of the action attribute, the action attribute is set
        to the baseActionURL.

      <li><b>all</b>: The action attribute is set to the baseActionURL.
        If either the action attribute is empty or the cw_xml
	parameter is equivalent to action attribute or the cw_xml equals
        the base URI of the action attribute, nothing else is done.  Otherwise
	a cw_xml parameter is added to aim the channel at the new URI
	specified in the <i>action</i> attribute.
    </ul>
          
  <li><b>&lt;a&gt;</b>  If the <i>href</i> attribute is a relative URL,
   the absolute URL is found using the cw_xml parameter.  Its value is
   then modified according to the value of <i>cw_passThrough</i>:

    <ul>
      <li><b>none</b> (default): href is as is unless it is a relative URL,
	 in which case it is prepended with the base URI.

      <li><b>marked</b>: if the href contains a query string parameter
	 named 'cw_inChannelLink', the href is replaced with baseActionURL
         concatenated with the original querystring.  The value of
	 cw_inChannelLink is ignored.

      <li><b>application</b>: if either the href attribute is empty or the
	 cw_xml parameter is equivalent to the absolute URL of the href
	 attribute, the href is set to the baseActionURL.

      <li><b>all</b>: The href is set to the baseActionURL.
	 If either the href attribute is empty or the cw_xml parameter is
	 equivalent to the href attribute or cw_xml equals the base URI
	 of the href attribute, nothing more is done.  Otherwise, a cw_xml
	 parameter is added with a value equivalent to that of the original
	 href.
    </ul>
          
  <li><b>&lt;img&gt;</b> if the <i>src</i> attribute is relative, it is
	prepended with the base URI.
</ul>
          
<h2>Session Support</h2>

<p>
  Support is provided for cookies as specified in the original Netscape
  specification, as well as RFC 2109 and RFC 2965.  Only the <b>Cookie</b>,
  <b>Cookie2</b>, <b>Set-Cookie</b>, and <b>Set-Cookie2</b> headers are
  currently processed.

<p>
  Cookies are not maintained between portal logins.  Once you logout of
  the portal, your cookies are discarded.

<p>
  Applications maintaining sessions via URL rewriting in http query strings
  should also work.  Other forms of URL rewriting to maintain state probably
  will not work.  Most applications use cookies by preference if available,
  which they are.

<h2>Issues and Limitations</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  JTidy must be recompiled to work with some servlet containers.  See
  <b><a href="#depend">Software Dependencies</a></b>.

 <li>
  The GET method is always used to send parameters to the
  back-end application, even if the portal got them from the
  application via POST.

 <li>
  Content is not cached.  Caching will need to follow http conventions.

 <li>
  HTML and XHTML <b>&lt;body&gt;</b> background colours and images are not
  reflected in the output.  This would require access to the <b>&lt;td&gt</b>
  element generated by the portal to contain the channel output.

 <li>
  URLs that use frames cannot be incorporated as channels.

 <li>
  Suppression of JTidy diagnostic output has not been tested on non-UNIX
  platforms.

 <li>
  The cw_reset=reset runtime command is not implemented yet.

 <li>
  Ideally there'd be a reset button alongside help, edit, etc., to
  trigger a portal event that could be caught by the channel.

 <li>
  If cw_xml is changed before cw_reset=return is called, your are returned
  to the last cw_xml used, not necessarily the one that was in use before a
  button event.

 <li>
  For security reasons, it might be a good idea to have a static data parameter
  which specifies limitations on what can be changed via runtime commands.

 <li>
  There should be a mechanism for passing authentication or IPerson
  information to the application.

 <li>
  The channel should be multithreaded for better performance.

 <li>
  The source html cannot specify a namespace if cw_tidy is on.

 <li>
  Multivalued http request attributes are not supported.

</ul>

<h3>Scripts</h3>
<p>
Limited support is provided for included scripts, but they may not work
exactly as they would when viewed directly.
exactly as they would when viewed directly.  Note in particular that if
your script replaces generates URLs, they will probably need to be absolute
URLs, not relative, to work through a portal.
</p>

<p>
XHTML 1.0 states that an XHTML document must be valid xml so if embedded
javascript code contains &lt;, &amp;, ]]&gt; or --,
it must be wrapped in a CDATA section element. however, cdata
sections are recognized by xml processors but not browsers. w3c states that
external scripts should be used if your script uses those character sequences.
CWebProxy supports embedded javasript containing these characters
only if it is wrapped in a CDATA section element and sent through tidy.
Note that the output will not be valid xml, and thus not valid XHTML.
</p>

<h2>Future Directions</h2>

<p>We plan to further examine all the issues addresses in the previous
section.  Adding multithreading and caching are priorities, as is proxying
security and IPerson info. to the backend applications.

<h2>Recent Changes</h2>
<ul>
 <li>March 19, 2002.  Minor documentation update, fixed typo.
 <li>February 22, 2002.  Minor documentation update.
 <li>February 15, 2002.  Documentation updates.
 <li>February 15, 2002.  Improved document handling for non-tidied urls.
			 DOCTYPES are now properly supported.
 <li>February 15, 2002.  Bugfixes: cw_xml static data parameter can now
			 contain a query string.  Another case where querystring
			 parameters were erroneously separated with a "?" has
			 been fixed.
 <li>January 30, 2002.  Minor documentation update.
 <li>November 29, 2001.  Documented JTidy problem workaround.
 <li>November 5, 2001.  Documentation update.
 <li>November 1, 2001.  Minor changes to xhtml.xsl for efficiency.
 <li>November 1, 2001.  Add relative path munging for script src attributes.
 <li>August 28, 2001.  Documentation update.
 <li>August 24, 2001.  XHTML stylesheet performance improvements.
			Throw exception on http return codes
			403, 500, 204 (as well as 404).
 <li>June 29, 2001.  Documentation update.
 <li>June 28, 2001.  Enhanced "marked" pass-though:  Added ability to
	distinguish between links equivalent to cw_xml and others, and
	support for connecting to non-cw_xml links.
 <li>June 22, 2001.  Improved cookie support.
 <li>June 22, 2001.  Added support for cw_passThrough="application".  It's
	semantics are the same as "all" used to be.  cw_passThrough="all"
	now sends <i>all</i> links through the portal.  This is handled
	entirely in the XHTML stylesheet.  The CWebProxy java code treats "all"
	and "application" identically.
 <li>June 22, 2001.  Added another Tomcat example.
 <li>June 22, 2001.  Added support for pre-parsing paths containing "../".
	Tomcat and Internet Explorer were not always handling these correctly,
	necessitating rewriting, as done by Netscape.
</ul>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>
The unmodified Tomcat numguess.jsp and servlet examples are now set up as
examples.
See the <a href="http://www.mun.ca/cc/portal/cw/num_help.html">numguess
help</a> and <a href="http://www.mun.ca/cc/portal/cw/servlet_help.html">servlet
help</a>.  These examples are available under the Subscription Channel, and
can be seen in the <b>Tests</b> tab of the demo user.

<p> A theoretical example:  Imagine an application that consists of a tree
of web pages.  The first page is a static XHTML page containing a few links.
Some of these should remain in the channel, others should leave the portal
framework.  This page should use <b>cw_passThrough="marked"</b>.  Since it
is the initial page of the application, we would indicate this in the
static data defining the channel.  Links that need to stay in the channel
should have <b>"?cw_inChannelLink=1"</b> appended to them.  (We will assume
the use of the XHTML stylesheets provided with CWebProxy.)

<p> Let's look at
possibilities for some of these marked links.  Perhaps one points to a set
of specially designed static pages that avoid outside links.  They are all
designed to fit in the channel.  We can set <b>cw_passThrough="all"</b> to
make writing the pages easier.  So when linking to this page from the top-level
page, we'd have something like:
<blockquote>
  <b>&lt;a href="second.html?cw_inChannelLink=1&cw_passThrough=all"&gt;</b>
</blockquote>

<p> Another second-level page might actually be an application implemented
by a CGI or via JSP, PHP, or whatever.  Let's assume that this one generates
HTML (as opposed to XHTML), and also generates a few links to outside web
pages, which we don't want to incorporate into the portal.  The link to this
this application should set the pass-through type to <b>"application"</b>.
It should also set <b>cw_tidy="on"</b> to convert the HTML to XHTML.

<a name="depend" />
<h2>Software Dependencies</h2>

<p>
CWebProxy uses the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jtidy/">JTidy</a>
package is used to convert HTML to XHTML.  It also requires the Servlet
engine to have Xalan's bsf.jar file in its classpath.

<p>
Under some servlet containers, JTidy r6 has a compatibility problem with
the classloader.  Tomcat 4.0.1 is one example.  If CWebProxy isn't working
and you see a line in your logfile that says:
<blockquote><tt>
	Registered an uncaughted exception java.lang.IllegalAccessError:
	try to access field org.w3c.tidy.ParserImpl._parseHead from class
	org.w3c.tidy.ParserImpl$ParseHTML
</tt></blockquote>

The JTidy developers have
<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/html-tidy/2001AprJun/0173.html">noted the problem</a>, and hopefully will fix it in the next release.  In the
meantime, it can be worked around by recompiling for your platform.  To
do this, get the <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jtidy/jtidy-04aug2000r6.zip">source distribution</a>, unzip it, build it with "ant jar", and
replace your old tidy.jar with build/Tidy.jar.  I've put a rebuilt Tidy.jar
<a href="tidy.jar">here</a>, if you'd prefer to try that first.
