    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    CWebProxy allows incorporation of web-based services as
    channels. It provides mechanisms for connecting to and
    rendering HTML and XML services. Pages are refreshed when they
    change. For applications under http, GET and POST parameters
    are passed through the portal to the application. This allows
    communcation between the browser and the back-end application.
    Cookies are are kept within CWebProxy, allowing dynamic http
    applications to maintain state. 
    <h2>Versions</h2>
    CWebProxy has been available as of uPortal 2.0 alpha. This
    documentation covers version 2.0 and its patch releases. A
    version is now available that works with uPortal 1.6, which is
    nearly identical to this one. uPortal 2.1 (available as of Dec.
    6th, 2002) features major changes in CWebProxy. It remains
    backwards-compatible with previous versions. See the <a
    href="index.html">CWebProxy 2.1 Documentation</a> for details. 
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    The key mechanism is "<i>pass-through</i>". It is the means for
    <i>passing</i> request parameters <i>through</i> the portal to
    the application. There are currently four levels of
    pass-through supported: 
    <p>Use "application" if you want references to the original
    cw_xml to stay in the channel, and other links to go outside
    the portal framework. Use "all" if you want all links generated
    by the first URL to stay in the channel. Use "marked" if you
    want to indicate precisely which links should stay in channel,
    and which should replace the framework, and "none" if you're
    not interested in having any of the links stay in-channel.</p>
    <p>Note that it is possible to change the pass-through type at
    any point, so if a link is followed that would best be served
    by another pass-though type, it is a trivial matter to change
    it at that time.</p>
    <h2>Static Data and Runtime Data</h2>
    With the exception of <b>cw_reset</b>, which is a runtime
    parameter only, parameters are identical for both static and
    runtime data. The channel state variables are initially set
    acccording to static data, or defaults. Runtime data modifies
    the equivalent channel state variables. All parameters are then
    passed through to the stylesheets based on the current state.
    The parameters are: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>cw_xml</b>: a URI representing the source XML or HTML
      document.</li>
      <li><b>cw_ssl</b>: a URI representing the corresponding .ssl
      (stylesheet list) file.</li>
      <li><b>cw_xslTitle</b>: a title representing the stylesheet
      (optional). If no title parameter is specified, a default
      stylesheet will be chosen according to the media.</li>
      <li><b>cw_xsl</b>: a URI representing the stylesheet to use.
      If <i>cw_xsl</i> is supplied, <i>cw_ssl</i> and
      <i>cw_xslTitle</i> will be ignored.</li>
      <li><b>cw_info</b>: a URI to be called for the <i>info</i>
      event.</li>
      <li><b>cw_help</b>: a URI to be called for the <i>help</i>
      event.</li>
      <li><b>cw_edit</b>: a URI to be called for the <i>edit</i>
      event.</li>
      <li><b>cw_tidy</b>: if set to <i>on</i>, filter the source
      document through JTidy, converting HTML to XHTML.</li>
      <li>
        <b>cw_passThrough</b>: indicates that runtime data is to be
        passed through. If <i>passThrough</i> is supplied, and not
        set to "none", additional runtime data parameters and
        values will be passed as request parameters to the
        <i>cw_xml</i>.<br />
        cw_passThrough values: 
        <ul>
          <li><b>none</b>: (default). Don't do anything.</li>
          <li><b>marked</b>: If runtime data includes
          <i>cw_inChannelLink</i>, pass through other runtime data
          as request parameters. Use in conjunction with a
          stylesheet that marks appropriate links with
          cw_inChannelLink as a request parameter, and replaces the
          URI with baseActionURL, possibly with cw_xml and maybe
          other parameters.</li>
          <li><b>all</b>: This parameter instructs the render
          routine to pass through all additional runtime data as
          http request parameters to xmlURI. Intended to support
          XHTML dynamic pages. With JTidy hooked in, can support
          HTML as well. Use in conjunction with a style sheet that
          re-routes all links through the portal.</li>
          <li><b>application</b>: The same as <i>all</i>. Use in
          conjunction with a style sheet that re-routes links for
          that application through the portal.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>cw_reset</b> An instruction to reset internal
      variables. The value <i>return</i> resets <i>cw_xml</i> to
      its last value before changed by button events. The value
      <i>reset</i> returns all variables to the static data values.
      (reset not impl. yet.) Runtime data parameter only.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: parameter names have changed from the previous version
    of CWebProxy. cw_xsl and cw_xslTitle are there for
    compatibility with CGenericXSLT and might go away.</p>
    <h3>Portal Events</h3>
    <p>CWebProxy supports the button events for <i>help</i>,
    <i>about</i>, and <i>edit</i>. A channel instance can specify
    URIs for any of these via static or runtime data. A button
    event will then redirect the channel to the appropriate URI.
    Note that separate stylesheets for button event URIs are not
    supported. The URI should return control to the original
    application via <i>cw_reset=return</i>.</p>
    <h2>Stylesheets</h2>
    <p>This stylesheet is set up for typical dynamic applications.
    You may need to make modifications to suit particular
    applications.</p>
    <h3>xhtml.xsl</h3>
    <p>For use with XHTML or HTML applications.</p>
    <p>The base URI is determined from cw_xml, or from the href
    element of the <b>&lt;base&gt;</b> tag, if one exists in the
    document head. Note that this is different from the
    baseActionURL, which is a URI referring to the channel via the
    portal.</p>
    <p><b>&lt;script&gt;</b> elements are copied from both
    <b>&lt;head&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;body&gt;</b>. Relative URIs in
    <i>src</i> attributes are prepended with the base URI.</p>
    <p>Children of <b>&lt;body&gt;</b> are copied as is, save for
    the following special processing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>&lt;form&gt;</b> If the <i>action</i> attribute is a
        relative URL, the absolute URL is found using the cw_xml
        parameter. Its value is then modified according to the
        value of <i>cw_passThrough</i>: 
        <ul>
          <li><b>none</b> (default): action is left as is unless it
          is a relative URL, in which case it is prepended with the
          base URI.</li>
          <li><b>marked</b>: if there's an <b>&lt;input&gt;</b>
          child of form with a name attribute called
          'cw_inChannelLink', the action attribute of the form is
          changed to equal the baseActionURL, no matter what the
          value was before.</li>
          <li><b>application</b>: if either the action attribute is
          empty or the cw_xml parameter is equivalent to the
          absolute URL of the action attribute, the action
          attribute is set to the baseActionURL.</li>
          <li><b>application</b>: if either the action attribute is
          empty or the cw_xml parameter is equivalent to action
          attribute or cw_xml equals the base URI of the action
          attribute, the action attribute is set to the
          baseActionURL.</li>
          <li><b>all</b>: The action attribute is set to the
          baseActionURL. If either the action attribute is empty or
          the cw_xml parameter is equivalent to action attribute or
          the cw_xml equals the base URI of the action attribute,
          nothing else is done. Otherwise a cw_xml parameter is
          added to aim the channel at the new URI specified in the
          <i>action</i> attribute.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>&lt;a&gt;</b> If the <i>href</i> attribute is a relative
        URL, the absolute URL is found using the cw_xml parameter.
        Its value is then modified according to the value of
        <i>cw_passThrough</i>: 
        <ul>
          <li><b>none</b> (default): href is as is unless it is a
          relative URL, in which case it is prepended with the base
          URI.</li>
          <li><b>marked</b>: if the href contains a query string
          parameter named 'cw_inChannelLink', the href is replaced
          with baseActionURL concatenated with the original
          querystring. The value of cw_inChannelLink is
          ignored.</li>
          <li><b>application</b>: if either the href attribute is
          empty or the cw_xml parameter is equivalent to the
          absolute URL of the href attribute, the href is set to
          the baseActionURL.</li>
          <li><b>all</b>: The href is set to the baseActionURL. If
          either the href attribute is empty or the cw_xml
          parameter is equivalent to the href attribute or cw_xml
          equals the base URI of the href attribute, nothing more
          is done. Otherwise, a cw_xml parameter is added with a
          value equivalent to that of the original href.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>&lt;img&gt;</b> if the <i>src</i> attribute is
      relative, it is prepended with the base URI.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Session Support</h2>
    <p>Support is provided for cookies as specified in the original
    Netscape specification, as well as RFC 2109 and RFC 2965. Only
    the <b>Cookie</b>, <b>Cookie2</b>, <b>Set-Cookie</b>, and
    <b>Set-Cookie2</b> headers are currently processed.</p>
    <p>Cookies are not maintained between portal logins. Once you
    logout of the portal, your cookies are discarded.</p>
    <p>Applications maintaining sessions via URL rewriting in http
    query strings should also work. Other forms of URL rewriting to
    maintain state probably will not work. Most applications use
    cookies by preference if available, which they are.</p>
    <h2>Issues and Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>JTidy must be recompiled to work with some servlet
      containers. See <b><a href="#depend">Software
      Dependencies</a></b>.</li>
      <li>The GET method is always used to send parameters to the
      back-end application, even if the portal got them from the
      application via POST.</li>
      <li>Content is not cached. Caching will need to follow http
      conventions.</li>
      <li>HTML and XHTML <b>&lt;body&gt;</b> background colours and
      images are not reflected in the output. This would require
      access to the <b>&lt;td&gt;</b> element generated by the
      portal to contain the channel output.</li>
      <li>Any <b>&lt;link&gt;</b> elements from the <b>&lt;head&gt;</b>
      of an HTML document, including those that reference CSS stylesheets,
      are not reflected in the output.  This would require
      access to the <b>&lt;head&gt;</b> element generated by the portal.</li>
      <li>URLs that use frames cannot be incorporated as
      channels.</li>
      <li>Suppression of JTidy diagnostic output has not been
      tested on non-UNIX platforms.</li>
      <li>When using JTidy, the character encoding must be specified
      in the HTTP headers, otherwise the default ASCII is assumed.
      JTidy does not yet recognize the use of the HTML meta element 
      for specifying the character encoding.</li>
      <li>The cw_reset=reset runtime command is not implemented
      yet.</li>
      <li>Ideally there'd be a reset button alongside help, edit,
      etc., to trigger a portal event that could be caught by the
      channel.</li>
      <li>If cw_xml is changed before cw_reset=return is called,
      your are returned to the last cw_xml used, not necessarily
      the one that was in use before a button event.</li>
      <li>For security reasons, it might be a good idea to have a
      static data parameter which specifies limitations on what can
      be changed via runtime commands.</li>
      <li>There should be a mechanism for passing authentication or
      IPerson information to the application.</li>
      <li>The channel should be multithreaded for better
      performance.</li>
      <li>The source html cannot specify a namespace if cw_tidy is
      on.</li>
      <li>Multivalued http request attributes are not
      supported.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Scripts</h3>
    <p>Limited support is provided for included scripts, but they
    may not work exactly as they would when viewed directly.
    exactly as they would when viewed directly. Note in particular
    that if your script replaces generates URLs, they will probably
    need to be absolute URLs, not relative, to work through a
    portal.</p>
    <p>XHTML 1.0 states that an XHTML document must be valid xml so
    if embedded javascript code contains &lt;, &amp;, ]]&gt; or --,
    it must be wrapped in a CDATA section element. however, cdata
    sections are recognized by xml processors but not browsers. w3c
    states that external scripts should be used if your script uses
    those character sequences. CWebProxy supports embedded
    javasript containing these characters only if it is wrapped in
    a CDATA section element and sent through tidy. Note that the
    output will not be valid xml, and thus not valid XHTML.</p>
    <h2>Future Directions</h2>
    <p>We plan to further examine all the issues addresses in the
    previous section. Adding multithreading and caching are
    priorities, as is proxying security and IPerson info. to the
    backend applications.</p>
    <h2>Recent Changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>March 19, 2002. Minor documentation update, fixed
      typo.</li>
      <li>February 22, 2002. Minor documentation update.</li>
      <li>February 15, 2002. Documentation updates.</li>
      <li>February 15, 2002. Improved document handling for
      non-tidied urls. DOCTYPES are now properly supported.</li>
      <li>February 15, 2002. Bugfixes: cw_xml static data parameter
      can now contain a query string. Another case where
      querystring parameters were erroneously separated with a "?"
      has been fixed.</li>
      <li>January 30, 2002. Minor documentation update.</li>
      <li>November 29, 2001. Documented JTidy problem
      workaround.</li>
      <li>November 5, 2001. Documentation update.</li>
      <li>November 1, 2001. Minor changes to xhtml.xsl for
      efficiency.</li>
      <li>November 1, 2001. Add relative path munging for script
      src attributes.</li>
      <li>August 28, 2001. Documentation update.</li>
      <li>August 24, 2001. XHTML stylesheet performance
      improvements. Throw exception on http return codes 403, 500,
      204 (as well as 404).</li>
      <li>June 29, 2001. Documentation update.</li>
      <li>June 28, 2001. Enhanced "marked" pass-though: Added
      ability to distinguish between links equivalent to cw_xml and
      others, and support for connecting to non-cw_xml links.</li>
      <li>June 22, 2001. Improved cookie support.</li>
      <li>June 22, 2001. Added support for
      cw_passThrough="application". It's semantics are the same as
      "all" used to be. cw_passThrough="all" now sends <i>all</i>
      links through the portal. This is handled entirely in the
      XHTML stylesheet. The CWebProxy java code treats "all" and
      "application" identically.</li>
      <li>June 22, 2001. Added another Tomcat example.</li>
      <li>June 22, 2001. Added support for pre-parsing paths
      containing "../". Tomcat and Internet Explorer were not
      always handling these correctly, necessitating rewriting, as
      done by Netscape.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>The unmodified Tomcat numguess.jsp and servlet examples are
    now set up as examples. See the <a
    href="http://www.mun.ca/cc/portal/cw/num_help.html">numguess
    help</a> and <a
    href="http://www.mun.ca/cc/portal/cw/servlet_help.html">servlet
    help</a>. These examples are available under the Subscription
    Channel, and can be seen in the <b>Tests</b> tab of the demo
    user.</p>
    <p>A theoretical example: Imagine an application that consists
    of a tree of web pages. The first page is a static XHTML page
    containing a few links. Some of these should remain in the
    channel, others should leave the portal framework. This page
    should use <b>cw_passThrough="marked"</b>. Since it is the
    initial page of the application, we would indicate this in the
    static data defining the channel. Links that need to stay in
    the channel should have <b>"?cw_inChannelLink=1"</b> appended
    to them. (We will assume the use of the XHTML stylesheets
    provided with CWebProxy.)</p>
    <p>Let's look at possibilities for some of these marked links.
    Perhaps one points to a set of specially designed static pages
    that avoid outside links. They are all designed to fit in the
    channel. We can set <b>cw_passThrough="all"</b> to make writing
    the pages easier. So when linking to this page from the
    top-level page, we'd have something like:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <b>&lt;a
      href="second.html?cw_inChannelLink=1&amp;cw_passThrough=all"&gt;</b>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Another second-level page might actually be an application
    implemented by a CGI or via JSP, PHP, or whatever. Let's assume
    that this one generates HTML (as opposed to XHTML), and also
    generates a few links to outside web pages, which we don't want
    to incorporate into the portal. The link to this this
    application should set the pass-through type to
    <b>"application"</b>. It should also set <b>cw_tidy="on"</b> to
    convert the HTML to XHTML. <a id="depend"
    name="depend"></a></p>
    <h2>Software Dependencies</h2>
    <p>CWebProxy uses the <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jtidy/">JTidy</a> package
    is used to convert HTML to XHTML. It also requires the Servlet
    engine to have Xalan's bsf.jar file in its classpath.</p>
    <p>Under some servlet containers, JTidy r6 has a compatibility
    problem with the classloader. Tomcat 4.0.1 is one example. If
    CWebProxy isn't working and you see a line in your logfile that
    says:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <tt>Registered an uncaughted exception
      java.lang.IllegalAccessError: try to access field
      org.w3c.tidy.ParserImpl._parseHead from class
      org.w3c.tidy.ParserImpl$ParseHTML</tt>
    </blockquote>
    The JTidy developers have <a
    href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/html-tidy/2001AprJun/0173.html">
    noted the problem</a>, and hopefully will fix it in the next
    release. In the meantime, it can be worked around by
    recompiling for your platform. To do this, get the <a
    href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jtidy/jtidy-04aug2000r6.zip">
    source distribution</a>, unzip it, build it with "ant jar", and
    replace your old tidy.jar with build/Tidy.jar. I've put a
    rebuilt Tidy.jar <a href="tidy.jar">here</a>, if you'd prefer
    to try that first.
