	<title>uPortal Copyright Header</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>uPortal copyright header</h1>
      <p>Code developed for or contributed to uPortal is distributed under the uPortal license agreement.
		This page describes how we document this in our code.</p>
      <h2>Basic example</h2>
<p>A new .java file first added in 2004 might look like this:</p>
	<pre>/* Copyright 2004 The JA-SIG Collaborative.  All rights reserved.
*  See license distributed with this file and
*  available online at http://www.uportal.org/license.html
*/

package org.jasig.portal.portlet.dao.springjdbc;

import org.springframework.jdbc.core.support.JdbcDaoSupport;

/**
 * Ancestor of all Spring JDBC-based DAO implementations.
 * @author Mike DeSimone, mike@rsmart.com
 * @version $Revision$
 */
public abstract class BaseSpringDao extends JdbcDaoSupport {

}</pre>
      <h2>Points to note</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The header is the very first text in the file.  
		It comes before the package declaration, the import statements, 
		the type JavaDoc comment, and the class declaration itself.</li>
	<li>The header is only four lines long.  It serves as a pointer to the license.html
		file distributed with uPortal and available online.</li>
	<li>There is exactly one line of whitespace between the copyright header comment
		and the package declaration.  More space would be wasted space, causing the reader
		to be more likely to have to scroll to get to the meat of things.  No space would be less
		legible.</li>
</ul> 
	
      <h2>Copyright years</h2>
<p>The copyright years are the years in which significant work is done on the file.  
	If the file is continually edited every year between 1981 and 1984, 
	a copyright year range of 1981-1984 is appropriate.  
	If the file is edited in 1942, 1945, and 1947, 
	"Copyright 1942, 1945, 1947  The JA-SIG Collaborative ..." is appropriate.  
	Trivial edits do not update the copyright year; 
	edits sufficiently significant that you feel like adding yourself as an 
	author on the file, whether you do or not, likely warrant adding the 
	current year to the copyright header's year list or range.</p>
