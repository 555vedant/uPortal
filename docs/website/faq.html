<li><b>Where can I find this FAQ on the World-Wide Web?<a name="1_4"></a></b> 
<p> You can find the FAQ on the JA-SIG website, located at http://www.ja-sig.org/ 
You can always find the latest version in the docs/ directory of the uPortal source 
code repository. See the uPortal web site for details about participant access 
to the source code repository. 
</li>
</ol>
<h4>General Questions about uPortal<a name="2_0"></a> </h4>
<ol>
<li><b>What exactly is uPortal? </b> 
<p>Simply put, uPortal is a framework for producing a campus portal. We don't 
intend it to be an out-of-the-box or "turn key" portal "solution". Instead, uPortal 
is a set of Java classes and XML/XSL documents that you can use to produce a portal 
for use on your campus. </p>
<li><b>Who is developing uPortal? </b> 
<p>JA-SIG, the Java in Administration Special Interest Group. Several JA-SIG member 
institutions are collaborating on the development of uPortal, and they make the 
code itself available as a reference implementation to any member institution 
of higher education at no cost. </p>
<li><b>What level of Java knowledge is required to use JA-SIG's uPortal framework? 
</b> 
<p>This is really three different questions rolled into one, because there are 
three different "levels" that we can use to discuss what you have to understand 
in order to "use" the uPortal framework. These levels aren't totally distinct 
- there's considerable overlap between them. Let's consider them one at a time. 
</p>
<p> One level addresses what you have to know in order to keep an instance of 
the portal, customized for your campus' requirements and IT infrastructure, running 
under your chosen application server. I'll call that the "administrative" level, 
since a lot of the tasks are closely analogous to administering a DBMS or HTTP 
server. See the section called "Deploying, administering and maintaining your 
portal", below. </p>
<p>The second level addresses what you must know in order to do the development 
necessary to produce an instance of the portal, customized for your campus' needs 
and IT infrastructure, that you'll use to facilitate the delivery of content and 
services to end-users. I'll call that the "implementation" level. See the section 
called "Developing your campus portal", below. </p>
<p>The third level addresses what you must know in order to develop programs (which 
the uPortal developers call channels) that will work within the portal to actually 
deliver the content and services. I'll call that the "content development" level. 
See the section called "Developing content and applications for use with uPortal 
", below. </p>
<li><b>Will uPortal run on all platforms?</b> 
<p> uPortal will run on any platform that has a Java 2 implementation available 
for it. JA-SIG members are running uPortal for development and deployment purposes 
on a number of different platforms, including Microsoft Windows, Solaris, Linux 
on 3 different architectures and MacOS X. </p>
</li>
<li> <b>What differentiates uPortal from other portal solutions? </b>
<p>The primary differentiator is that uPortal is focused on the requirements of 
higher education institutions, whereas other products are mostly focused on the 
requirements of large corporations, even if the product is marketed to higher 
education institutions. uPortal is a framework that provides the Java programmers 
on your staff with the classes, interfaces, XML data files and XSL stylesheets 
they need to develop a customized portal for your campus. JA-SIG realizes that 
a portal, in order to be truly useful, can't something you take out of a box and 
install, it has to be something you customize for the needs of your institution. 
Some portal "solutions" are actually third party packages that a vendor of a non-Java, 
non-portal product acquired in order to enter the portal market without doing 
any R & D. uPortal was designed from the ground up to provide the tools you need 
to build a portal and has always been is a 100% pure Java. Still other portal 
"solutions" are services that are no charge to your campus, but require your campus 
to accept advertising in exchange for the use of the service. With uPortal, you 
don't have to run advertising in your portal, but if you wish to, your campus 
can keep the revenue produced. Last but not least, uPortal is also available free 
to member universities, most commercial portal "solutions" cost upwards of $50,000 
per year for a typical campus' license.</p>
</ol>
<h4>Deploying, administering and maintaining your portal<a name="3_0"></a></h4>
<ol>
<li><b>What kind of Java expertise would I need to have in order to successfully deploy and keep my campus instance of the portal running? </b> 
<p>In general, over and above a working knowledge of and substantial experience 
with your chosen application server, you really have to understand the issues 
related to server-side application deployment and support in a modern, web-based 
environment. If you understand how to start, stop, and backup your your application 
server and atabase server, and how to deploy a JSP 1.1/Servlet 2.2-based web application, 
then you know enough to administer a uPortal instance. Your application server 
vendor will be able to help you on this front with training and documentation 
if you don't. </p>
<li><b>What application server should I use for my campus' uPortal instance? 
</b>
<p>uPortal will run in conjunction with any application server that complies with 
the Java Servlet 2.2 and Java Server Pages 1.1 specifications. There are members 
of JA-SIG currently operating uPortal instances with BEA's WebLogic, IBM's Websphere, 
and Caucho's Resin, among others. Please don't think that uPortal is somehow dependent 
upon Tomcat, the open-source JSP and servlet container from the Apache Jakarta 
project that ships with the existing "monterey" distribution and soon-to-be-released 
"plymouth" distribution. You can use any JSP 1.1/Servlet 2.2-compliant container 
or application server, and if you want commercial quality tech support, formal 
training or documentation, then a commercial application server is something to 
consider. </p>
<li><b>Does uPortal support single-sign on? </b>
<p>A qualified "Yes". The uPortal framework does provide an authentication system that
explicitly supports the notion of single sign-on, but as of this writing there 
are few
channels that ship with the framework which take advantage of it. Of course, any
campus that wants to write their own channels that will use the uPortal single 
sign-on
capabilities are certainly able to do so. <br>
</p>
<li><b>Does uPortal support LDAP authentication? </b>
<p> Yes. The problem, however, is that there are dozens of possible ways to do 
an LDAP
authentication for uPortal and hence what is available now may not be useful for 
your
campus. But there are a few Universities now who are using uPortal in conjunction 
with<br>
an LDAP server to authenticate users. There is a reference implementation available<br>
now for uPortal which handles authentication of users to the portal from information<br>
stored in an LDAP server.</p>
<li><b>Why doesn't uPortal use JAAS for authentication and/or authorization?</b>
<p> JAAS enables services to authenticate and enforce access controls upon users, 
but as currently specified by Sun, it makes many assumptions about how the services 
which use it will operate for effective use in a portal. JAAS allows authentication 
modules to be &quot;plugged in&quot; but doesn't allow services to modify the 
behavior of the system as a whole.</p>
<p>uPortal doesn't operate the way that JAAS assumes because a portal, any portal, 
must aggregate content and applications from disparate sources. uPortal must have an
authentication mechanism that behaves differently than JAAS does because a portal
must support single sign-on to applications which have their own, disparate
authentication and/or authorization requirements.</p>
<p> The bottom line is that the uPortal developers think that authentication and 
authorization are currently too tightly coupled within JAAS, and would therefore delay the
implementation of single sign-on in uPortal until Sun publishes a later revision 
of the JAAS specification which decouples them. Perhaps in the future JAAS could 
provide uPortal with security services, but in it's current state it does not 
have the flexibility nor the functionality to be incorporated well into uPortal.</p>
</ol>
<h4>Developing your campus portal<a name="4_0"></a> </h4>
<ol>
<li><b>What kind of Java expertise is necessary to develop a campus portal using uPortal?</b>
<p>In general, to use the uPortal framework to develop a campus portal (the &quot;instance&quot; 
of the portal for use with your application server), over and above the level 
of expertise necessary to administer your application server (see above), you 
must be an experienced Java programmer, familiar with the JDK 1.2 tools for compiling, 
packaging, deploying<br>
and running server-side Java programs, and conversant with most of the technologies 
that comprise the J2EE specification. Specifically, at a minimum, you must have 
experience with:</p>
<p> &middot; XML. The uPortal framework uses XML and XSLT extensively to ensure 
the platform independence of data and to separate that data from it's presentation. 
To develop a portal with uPortal, you will have to create/edit XML files and create/edit 
XSL stylesheets. If you're not fluent with the XML-related APIs in Java, [McLaughlin2000] 
provides a comprehensive tutorial on writing Java programs that can create and 
manipulate XML documents. The uPortal developers highly recommend [Kay2000] to 
those looking for a tutorial and in-depth reference guide to XSLT. [Bradley2000] 
provides a guide to the overall XSL standard.</p>
<p> &middot; JSP: The portal framework uses Java Server Pages to facilitate the 
intermixing of markup language code required<br>
by a web browser and programming language code that leverages the underlying Java 
Runtime environment. If you<br>
want to change the look and feel of the portal substantially, you'll have to edit 
Java Server Pages, so you should<br>
understand how to use JSP syntax correctly. For those looking for a tutorial on 
JSP, [Manning] is an excellent choice. <br>
</p>
<p>&middot; Servlets. JSP works as an abstraction layer on top of the Java Servlets 
API and because of this, experience writing<br>
servlets will come in handy. Several programming 'idioms' in the portal code originated 
with Servlet programming.<br>
Although now a little dated, [Hunter1998] is a great tutorial on Java Servlets. 
The publisher expects to release a new<br>
edition soon. </p>
<p> &middot; SQL. The portal requires the use of a relational database to store 
some user, authentication, and channel subscription information, and the standard 
way to issue requests to a relational database server is using SQL, the Structured 
Query Language. You must therefore be familiar with the syntax and proper use 
of SQL in order to work with the uPortal framework. [Gulutzan1999] offers comprehensive 
coverage of the SQL standard. I say these are minimums because if you want to 
deliver something over and above the minimum functionality (for example authenticating 
via an LDAP server) then you'll have to be familiar with other J2EE technologies 
and/or APIs (for example, JNDI). </p>
<li><b>You keep writing that uPortal is a framework. Isn't that just an empty yuppie marketing word?</b>
<p>No. I'm using the word 'framework' in it's widely-accepted, Software Engineering 
sense[Wirfs-Brock1991]. A framework is a reusable design, expressed as a set of 
classes, that can serve as a solution to a family of related problems and support 
reuse at a larger granularity than classes. A mature framework allows components 
to be reusedas &quot;black boxes&quot;, that is, a programmer can incorporate 
them into a system under construction without knowing their implementations [Johnson1998]. 
Most frameworks in widespread use today are for constructing graphical user interfaces 
(GUIs) for traditional desktop applications. uPortal is different in that it's 
a framework for developing a web portal and developing content for display within 
that portal, but the underlying principal of both kinds of frameworks is the same: 
the framework provides programmers with an infrastructure that supports a coherent 
architectural model, allowing developers to concentrate on applying their expertise 
to the problem domain. In the case of uPortal, the framework takes care of the 
common functionality that every portal needs, so that you can implement the parts 
that are important and specific to your campus.
</p>
</ol>

<h4>Developing content and applications for use with uPortal<a name="5_0"></a> 
</h4>
<ol>
<li><b>What kind of expertise is necessary to develop content and/or applications for use with uPortal?</b> 
<p> It depends upon what kind of content you want to deliver through the portal. 
For simplest content provision, you only have to know how to produce an html document. 
One of the defined kinds of channels for use with uPortal is an RSS (RichSite 
Summary) channel, the same format that Netscape uses for their Internet portal. 
If you create an XML document which adheres to this standard , the uPortal framework 
will handle formatting and presenting the output for you. To deliver content which 
requires complex user interaction, you'll have to create a complete web application 
which uses a channel as its user interface. This approach requires that you have 
the XML, Servlets and SQL skills that someone developing a campus portal instance 
using uPortal has (see above) as well as experience with:</p>
<p> &middot; JDBC. It's likely you will want your application to store information 
in and retrieve information from a database, so<br>
the ability to use the Java Database Connectivity API will be essential. The portal 
itself requires a relational database<br>
to store information related to users and their preferences, and the standard 
way for your application to access this<br>
information is by using JDBC. If you're not familiar with the JDBC API, [White1999] 
is a comprehensive tutorial, reference and source of sample code <br>
</p>
<p>&middot; EJB. If your application requires distributed data access, transactions 
and persistence, the Enterprise Java Beans
distributed component model will probably become an important part of your architecture. 
For EJB beginners, [Monson-Haefel2000] provides a complete reference. To get an 
idea of what you're in for when you begin developing channnels, carefully read 
Michael Oltz' tutorial . 
</p>
<li><b>My university has a large number of legacy applications that we want 
to provide access to from the portal. Can I do this?</b>
<p> 
Maybe. It depends upon the application. Did you write the application (and have 
the source code) or did you purchase a binary package from a vendor? If you have the
source code, its relatively easy to create an alternate user interface to the
application that operates within the portal. in uPortal parlance, this would be 
called a &quot;channel&quot;. Your channel would display itself to the user in the portal 
and feed the input from that user to your application. Your legacy application would then process 
the data and send the output back to the channel, and the channel would in turn display 
the results to the user inside the portal. </p>
<p>
If you purchased an application from a vendor, things are a bit more complicated, 
but the high-level approach is the same. You'd have to write an adaptor that would 
wrap the output of the legacy application in XML so that it can be displayed inside the 
portal. When you have this, you can then write a channel for use with the portal that 
interacts with your adaptor and actually facilitates the translation of the XML so that 
the portal can display it.
