<h1>uPortal Roadmap</h1>

<p>
The uPortal community would like uPortal to support
Portlets. Portlets are java technology-based web components described in the
Java<sup>TM</sup> Portlet Specification developed by the 
<a href="http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/168.jsp">JSR 168</a> Expert Group. It has been proposed that Portlet support is introduced to uPortal in 2
phases.  The first phase exposes Portlets to the uPortal container though a Portlet-to-Channel adapter.
The second phase entails major changes to the uPortal framework as it
replaces the Channel with the Portlet as the main component managed by the
portal.
</p>

<p>
The work completed in Phase 1 will be released to the
community as part of uPortal 2.3.  Other uPortal features unrelated to Portlets
may also be included in uPortal 2.3. Phase 2 will be released as uPortal 3.0.  
Both releases will contain a Portlet container supplied by the 
Apache <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/pluto/">Pluto</a> project.
