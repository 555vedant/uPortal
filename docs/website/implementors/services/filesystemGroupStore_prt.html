<h2>The Filesystem Group Store</h2>
</div>
<br>
The filesystem group store lets you create a group service from lists
of user ids in file system files.&nbsp; The files and directories in the
filesystem model the groups and their members in the group system.&nbsp;
The filesystem adaptor is meant to help get you up and running quickly
and to encourage experimentation.&nbsp; You can use it to bridge the gap
between portal start-up and the time when your users are correctly
affiliated in LDAP, and it can supplement other membership sources with
quirky data that doesn't fit anywhere else.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The store class, <code>org.jasig.portal.groups.filesystem.FileSystemGroupStore</code>,
implements <code>IEntityGroupStore</code>, <code>IEntityStore</code>
and a no-op <code>IEntitySearcher</code>.  You can substitute a
functional entity searcher by adding it to the group service element for
this component in the configuration document, <code>compositeGroupServices.xml</code>.
<p>The directories and files look something like this: </p>
<p></p>
<code>--&nbsp;groups root (perhaps "/apps/portal/groups")<br>
</code>
<blockquote><code>&nbsp;|--&nbsp;org.jasig.portal.ChannelDefinition
(directory)<br>
  </code>
  <blockquote><code>&nbsp;|--&nbsp;channel definition file1<br>
&nbsp;|--&nbsp;channel definition file2<br>
&nbsp;[ other channel definition files ]<br>
    </code></blockquote>
  <code>&nbsp;|--&nbsp;org.jasig.portal.security.IPerson (directory)<br>
  </code>
  <blockquote><code>&nbsp;|--&nbsp;person directory1<br>
    </code>
    <blockquote><code>&nbsp;|--&nbsp;person file1 <br>
&nbsp;|--&nbsp;person file2 <br>
&nbsp;[ other person files ]<br>
      </code> </blockquote>
    <code>&nbsp;|--&nbsp;person directory2 <br>
    </code></blockquote>
  <code> etc.</code><br>
</blockquote>
<p> The groups <span style="font-style: italic;">root</span> is a file
system directory declared in the group service   configuration document,
as an attribute of the filesystem group   service element. This
directory has sub-directories, each named for the   underlying entity
type contained by groups in that sub-directory.  If a   service only
contains groups of IPersons, the groups root would have 1 sub-directory
named org.jasig.portal.security.IPerson. </p>
<p> A directory named for a type may contain both sub-directories and
files. The sub-directories represent groups that can contain other
groups. The   files represent groups that can contain entity as well as
group members.   The files contain keys, one to a line, and look like
this: </p>
<p></p>
<hr width="100%"><code> #&nbsp;this is a comment<br>
#&nbsp;another comment<br>
<br>
Moe&nbsp; this is ignored<br>
Larry<br>
group:org.jasig.portal.security.IPerson/someDirectory/someFile<br>
Curly<br>
&nbsp;# comment </code> <br>
<hr width="100%">
<p> Blank lines and lines starting with <code>FileSystemGroupStore.COMMENT</code>
(here "<code>#</code>") are ignored.  The first token on a non-ignored
line is assumed to be a group member key.  If the key starts with&nbsp; <code>FileSystemGroupStore.GROUP_PREFIX</code>
(here <code>":group</code><code>"</code>), it is treated as a local
group key.  Otherwise, it is assumed to be an entity key.  The rest of
the tokens on the line are ignored. </p>
<p> The example above contains 3 entity keys, <code>Moe</code>, <code>Larry</code>,
and <code>Curly</code>, and 1 group key, <code>org.jasig.portal.security.IPerson/someDirectory/someFile</code>.
It represents a group with 3 entity members and 1 group member.  The
local key of a group is its file path starting at the type name.&nbsp;
If the <span style="font-style: italic;">nodeSeparator </span>for the
composite configuration is ".", the <code>FileSystemGroupStore.SUBSTITUTE_PERIOD</code>
("$") is substituted for the real period character in a group key, so
the group entry in this example would be <code>org$jasig$portal$security$IPerson/someDirectory/someFile</code>.<br>
</p>
<p>To demonstrate how this actually works, try the following short <a
 href="filesystemGroupService_tutorial.html">filesystem group service
tutorial</a> (estimated time 15 minutes) on the base distribution. <br>
</p>
<p>Although they're easy to create, filesystem groups work like other
groups: they can be associated with Permissions, they can become group
members, you can browse and select (though not update) them in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Groups Manager</span>.&nbsp; However,
since they are not <span style="font-style: italic;">internally-managed</span>,
they cannot contain foreign memberships (groups from other services)
and membership changes are not guaranteed to show up in real time.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>Note also that the store class is not a singleton, so you can have
multiple filesystem services pointing to different "root" directories. </p>
