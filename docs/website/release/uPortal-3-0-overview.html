  <title>Guide to Working with Portlets in uPortal 2.3</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">uPortal 3.0 Overview<br>
</h1>
uPortal 3.0 will acheive the following:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>Terminology and paradigm change: Channels replaced by Portlets</h3>
The main integration component between an application and a portal will
change from a uPortal 2.x Channel to a JSR 168 Portlet.&nbsp; The
domain objects within uPortal 3.0 will reflect this change.&nbsp;
Terminology throughout the database and graphical user interfaces will
also change.&nbsp; uPortal 3.0 will continue to&nbsp; use Apache Pluto,
a Portlet Container, to manage the interaction with Portlets.&nbsp; A
Portlet deployment tool will be provided.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Componentization of framework<br>
    </h3>
Implementations of uPortal interfaces will be easily configurable.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Modular rendering pipeline<br>
    </h3>
The rendering pipeline will be organized into customizable
Contexts.&nbsp; Each context will be able to define a series of
components used to make up the complete rendering pipeline.&nbsp; A
default Context will be supplied that will emulate the SAX-based
rendering pipeline with structure and theme transformations from
uPortal 2.x.</li>
  <li>
    <h3>Clean separation of business logic and persistance layer<br>
    </h3>
Pure Data Access Objects (DAO) will be definied to meet uPortal 3.0's
storage requirements.&nbsp; An implementation for each DAO interface
will be supplied and will make use of the Spring JDBC Abstraction
library.&nbsp; The DAO implementations will be restricted to direct
communication with the underlying database and will be free of business
logic.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Full support for uPortal 2.x Channels<br>
    </h3>
Channels based on the uPortal 2.x channel interfaces (IChannel,
IMultithreadedchannel, IPrivilegedChannel, etc) will continue to run in
uPortal 3.0.&nbsp; A new ChannelAdapter will be provided for this
purpose. ChannelArchive (CAR) files will also be supported in uPortal
3.0.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Upgrade tools<br>
    </h3>
Tools will include a database conversion tool and stylesheet
converstion tool that will enable migration from an implementation of
uPortal 2.x version to uPortal 3.0. Upgrading from uPortal 2.x to 3.0
will be possible without losing published channel and user layout
information.&nbsp; Structure and theme XSLT stlyehseets will not need
to be redesigned.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
