<h1 style="text-align: center;">uPortal 3.0 Overview<br>
</h1>
uPortal 3.0 will acheive the following:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>Terminology and paradigm change: Channels replaced by Portlets</h3>
The main integration component between an application and a portal will
change from a uPortal 2.x Channel to a JSR 168 Portlet.&nbsp; The
domain objects within uPortal 3.0 will reflect this change.&nbsp;
Terminology throughout the database and graphical user interfaces will
also change.&nbsp; uPortal 3.0 will continue to&nbsp; use Apache Pluto,
a Portlet Container, to manage the interaction with Portlets.&nbsp; A
Portlet deployment tool will be provided.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Componentization of framework<br>
    </h3>
uPortal will follow a component-based implementation strategy.&nbsp;
Component configuration files will provide a transparent view of the
overall architecture, facilitating further ehancements of the framework
and long-term maintenance of the codebase.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Modular rendering pipeline<br>
    </h3>
uPortal 3.0 will support the concept of multiple concurrent
presentation Contexts.&nbsp; Each Context will be able to define a
series of components used to make up the complete rendering
pipeline.&nbsp; A default Context will be supplied that will emulate
the SAX-based rendering pipeline with structure and theme
transformations from uPortal 2.x.</li>
  <li>
    <h3>Clean separation of business logic and persistance layer<br>
    </h3>
Pure Data Access Objects (DAO) will be definied to meet uPortal 3.0's
storage requirements.&nbsp; An implementation for each DAO interface
will be supplied and will make use of Spring JDBC.&nbsp; The DAO
implementations will be restricted to direct communication with the
underlying database and will be free of business logic.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Full support for uPortal 2.x Channels<br>
    </h3>
Channels based on the uPortal 2.x channel interfaces (IChannel,
IMultithreadedchannel) will continue to run in uPortal 3.0.&nbsp;
IPrivilegedChannels will be supported in a limited way, continuing to
make available the HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse, but not
allowing access to the internal portal control structures such as
ChannelManager.&nbsp; A new Channel Adapter will be provided for this
purpose. ChannelArchive (CAR) files will also be supported in uPortal
3.0.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Upgrade tools<br>
    </h3>
Tools will include a database conversion tool and stylesheet
converstion tool that will enable migration from an implementation of
uPortal 2.x version to uPortal 3.0. Upgrading from uPortal 2.x to 3.0
will be possible without losing published channel and user layout
information.&nbsp; Structure and theme XSLT stlyehseets will not need
to be redesigned.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
