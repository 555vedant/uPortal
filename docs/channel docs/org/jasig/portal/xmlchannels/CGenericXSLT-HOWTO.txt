CGenericXSLT HOWTO

Purpose: To demonstrate how to use the CGenericXSLT Channel.

Introduction and description:

The XCGenericXSLT channel is simple to use. It takes an xml document and a stylesheet list as parameters.
When a request to render is received, it takes the xml document and does a xsl transform on it.
The specific transform is determined by the SSL and the browser used to request it.



Example of channel definition:

<channel minimized="false" class="org.jasig.portal.xmlchannels.CGenericXSLT">
  <parameter value="Welcome to UBC" name="name"/>
  <parameter value="http://localhost/portal/welcome.xml" name="xml"/>
  <parameter value="webpages/ubc/stylesheets/channels/welcome.ssl" name="ssl"/>
</channel>

Channel description notes:
  The xml and ssl values can either be a fully qualified URL, or a relative file name.
  The file name is relative to the root directory of the portal.  Not the root directory of
  the web pages.  Also, use a relative file name wherever possible since this is faster then a
  URL.

Example of SSL (StyleSheetList):

<?xml version="1.0"?>

<?xml-stylesheet href="/stylesheets/regular.xsl"  type="text/xsl" media="netscape"?>
<?xml-stylesheet href="http://localhost:8080/portal/stylesheets/wml.xsl"  type="text/xsl" media="WAP"?>

<document>
</document>


SSL Notes:

The href can either be a relative file name (faster) or a fully qualified URL.
Note that a URL MUST use the full name with the 'http://'.
